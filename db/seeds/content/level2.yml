    #### Step 1:

     Find the view to overwrite. It may be defined on any module!

    `TIP` Use the inspector tools in your browser to locate something unique (more or less)

    ![](1e1p1.png)

    `TIP` Search in https://github.com/decidim/decidim for the located identifier

    ![](1e1p2.png)

    `PRO-TIP!` Download the source code of Decidim, Open Visual Studio Code and search for that identifier locally!

    #### Step 2:

    1. Copy the file `decidim-core/app/views/layouts/decidim/_wrapper.html.erb` in your editor.
    2. Change what you need.
    3. Save it in your own place replicating the folder structure (`app/views/layouts/decidim/_wrapper.html.erb`)

    #### Step 3:

     🎉 Check in local! http://localhost:3000/

    #### Step 1:

    Find the CSS-style to overwrite. It may be defined on any module!

    `TIP` Use the inspector tools in your browser to locate and manipulate the css class(es) implicated

    ![](1e2p1.png)

    #### Step 2:

    Copy the changed CSS into a new file in our custom autoloading folder

    ![](1e2p2.png)

    🍾 Check in local! http://localhost:3000/

  title: "Example 3: Add some Javascript"
  body: |
    **In this example we will apply also changes in CSS and HTML.**

    We will change the default behaviour of the main Hero’s text image by:

    1. Adding an external jQuery plugin
    2. Overwriting the html view to show a custom text instead of the text from admin settings
    3. Add a custom JS file

    ![](1e3p1.gif)

    `PRO-TIP!` Bad taste is a must for a hacker!

    #### Step 1:

    Add the jQuery plugin to the system.

    1) Download the jQuery plugin from:

       https://github.com/peachananr/simple-text-rotator

       a) JS file: `vendor/assets/javascripts/jquery.simple-text-rotator.js`

       b) CSS file: `vendor/assets/stylesheets/simpletextrotator.css`


    2) Edit `application.css` & `application.js` and tell them to require the downloaded files.

    ![](1e3p2.png)

    `IMPORTANT!` RELOAD THE SERVER NOW:

    ```bash
    docker-compose exec app bin/rails restart
    ```

    #### Step 2:

    Find the view to overwrite.

    `TIP` Use the inspector tools in your browser to locate a useful identifier (ie: `hero-heading`)

    ![](1e3p3.png)

    `hero-heading` seems reasonably unique

    `NOTE:` It is not a regular **html.erb** file!

    ![](1e3p4.png)

    #### Step 3:

    Overwrite the original view by creating a new one.

    Replicate folder structure and copy the original file: `decidim-core/app/cells/decidim/content_blocks/hero/show.erb`

    # ⬇⬇⬇

    In our folder: `app/cells/decidim/content_blocks/hero/show.erb`

    #### Step 4:

    Edit the file. `app/cells/decidim/content_blocks/hero/show.erb`

    We will remove any string coming from the database (sorry admins, no more Hero editing for you) and put a fixed phrase:

    ![](1e3p5.png)

    ```html
    Decidim Hacks is a <span class="rotate">cool, sexy, awesome, amazing, massive, terrible</span><br>place
    ```

    #### Step 5:

    Create your own javascript that initializes everything, for instance: `app/assets/javascripts/autoinclude/hero-fx.js`

    ![](1e3p6.png)

    🍾 Check in local! http://localhost:3000/

    #### Recapitulation:

    **Files changed:**

    ![](1e3p7.png)

    **Steps:**

    1. Added external (vendor) javascript/css to the project
    2. Configured Rails to load those files
    3. Restarted Rails
    4. Overwritten the Hero view.
    5. Applied some custom javascript (activate the plugin)


    #### Step 6:

    🎆 Enjoy something kitsch! http://localhost:3000/

e4:
  title: "Example 4: Add custom locales"
  body: |
    **In this example we will create a new FX like the previous example to use multi-language texts.**

    We will:

    1. Create the list of words that rotate as independent text entries in the app locales folder.
    2. Create a “helper” ruby method that will list the words for us in the view.
    3. Add a new javascript file to take care of this case.

    `NOTE:` Helpers cannot be defined this way in the previous example (it is not a regular rails **html.erb** file).

    #### Step 1:

    Edit the locales file: `config/locales/en.yml`

    Add some content in the YAML format:

    ![](1e4p1.png)

    #### Step 2:

    Edit the layout file: `app/views/layouts/decidim/_wrapper.html.erb`

    Change the previous “*Cool tweaks*” for the method we are going to use:

    ![](1e4p2.png)

    #### Step 3:

    Edit the helper’s file: `app/helpers/application_helpers.rb`

    Create the method `fancy_words`:

    ![](1e4p3.png)

    #### Step 5:

    Recapitulation:

  title: "Example 5: Overwrite non-configurable settings"
  body: |
    **In this example we will monkey-patch the Proposals method that check the titles of the proposals**

    We will:

    1. Identify the Proposal validation method
    2. Create a new initializer and overwrite the method to allow more flexible titles in proposals

    ![](1e5p1.png)

    #### Step 1:

    Find the class with the method.

    This can be difficult and requires time to study the code to do it properly. But… we’re feeling brave!

    `TIP:` start to search for the locale key and then where is it placed in the code:

    ![](1e5p2.png)

    Search where the locale key is used:

    ![](1e5p3.png)

    #### Step 2:

    Create a new initializer file. It will be used to monkey-patch the method found.

    For instance: `config/initializers/bananas_for_proposals.rb`

    Also: open the original file to copy and analize what we need.

    ![](1e5p4.png)

    #### Step 3:

    Edit the file and and register our hook for the class we want to monkeypatch.

    Copy the method exactly as it is. Then modify what you want.

    ![](1e5p5.png)

    #### Step 4:

    Reload the server. Everything modified inside initializers requires a server reload.

    ```bash
    docker-compose exec app bin/rails restart
    ```

    🍾 Behaviour modified! 🍻

    ![](1e5p6.png)
